            <p>The story will appear here when you click "Create Your Story!" Here is a sample story created with AI:<br><br>
                It was a sunny Thursday afternoon in November when Sally, James, and David decided to go on a hike together. They drove out to a state park a few hours away that had beautiful 
                wooded trails and scenic overlooks.<br><br>The hike started off pleasantly enough as they took in the fall colors and crisp air. After a couple of miles though, dark clouds 
                started rolling in. Sally suggested they turn back before it rained, but James and David insisted on pushing forward, saying it was just a passing shower.<br><br>The further 
                they went, the worse the weather got. Soon it was pouring rain with thunder and lightning crashing around them. The trail became muddy and slippery. Sally was getting cold and 
                repeatedly asked to head back. Still, James and David were determined to make it to the overlook they had heard so much about.<br><br>As the thunderstorm only intensified, Sally 
                became separated from her friends as she stopped to tie her shoe. She called out for them but they were too far ahead to hear. Now alone on the deserted trail and soaked by the 
                rain, Sally started panicking.<br><br>Meanwhile, James and David realized Sally was no longer behind them. They were worried about their friend being alone in the storm and 
                decided they had to turn back. Trudging through the mud, they retraced their steps until finally they found Sally shivering under a tree. The three friends were relieved to be 
                reunited.<br><br>The storm forced them to give up on reaching the scenic overlook and turn back early. As they returned to the parking lot, exhausted and drenched, they all 
                realized it would have been wise to listen to Sally's concerns from the beginning instead of stubbornly pursuing their goal. They learned to value caution and safety over 
                reckless adventure. Most importantly, they learned to stick together and look out for each other.

            <h2>About the Options</h2>
            <h3>Characters</h3>
            <p>A character is a person, or sometimes even an animal, who takes part in the action of a short story or other literary work.</p>
            <h3>Setting</h3>
            <p>The setting of a short story is the time and place in which it happens. Authors often use descriptions of landscape, scenery, buildings, seasons or weather to provide a 
                strong sense of setting.</p>
            <h3>Conflict</h3>
            <p>The conflict is a struggle between two people or things in a short story. The main character is usually on one side of the central conflict.
                On the other side, the main character may struggle against another important character, against the forces of nature, against society, or even against something inside 
                himself or herself (feelings, emotions, illness).</p>
            <h3>Theme</h3>
            <p>The theme is the central idea or belief in a short story.</p>
